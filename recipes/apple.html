            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Butter or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
         </ul> 
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to a specified temperature, typically around 350°F (175°C), and grease a baking pan.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and ground cinnamon. Mix well.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the butter or oil with the sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the milk and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, 
                mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the thinly sliced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the greased baking pan, spreading it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for the specified time, typically around 40-45 minutes
                 or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes.
                 Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li> 
            <li>Optionally, dust the cooled apple cake with powdered sugar, or serve it as is for a delicious treat.</li>        
         </ol>
