    <h2>Chicken recipe</h2>
    <p>Succulent chicken pieces marinated in a flavorful blend of herbs and spices, <br>
        grilled to perfection for a mouthwatering and juicy delight</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken pieces </li>
        <li>Olive oil or cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder or minced garlic</li>
        <li>Onion powder or finely chopped onions</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and any other desired spices or seasonings. 
            Ensure that the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat and add some oil to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully add the seasoned chicken pieces to the pan, 
            skin-side down if using bone-in chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for a few minutes on each side until they develop a golden brown crust. 
            This helps to seal in the juices and adds flavor.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) 
            using a meat thermometer. Cooking times may vary depending on the size and thickness of the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. 
            This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicier chicken.</li>
        <li>Optionally, garnish the chicken with fresh herbs,
             squeeze some lemon juice over it for added brightness, and serve it hot.</li>
    </ol>
