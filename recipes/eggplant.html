         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Eggplant (medium-sized)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour or breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
         </ul> 
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the eggplant. Wash the eggplant and trim off the ends. Then, slice the eggplant into even rounds
                 or lengthwise into strips, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Place the eggplant slices on a paper towel-lined tray or cutting board. 
                Sprinkle salt over both sides of the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 15-20 minutes. </li>
            <li>After the resting time, pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels to remove the released moisture.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or dish, beat the eggs. In a separate bowl or plate, add the flour or breadcrumbs. </li>
            <li>Dip each eggplant slice into the beaten eggs, making sure it is coated on both sides. Allow any excess egg to drip off.</li>
            <li>Next, coat the eggplant slice in the flour or breadcrumb mixture, ensuring that it is fully coated on all sides.
                 Gently press the coating onto the eggplant to help it adhere.</li>
            <li>Repeat the dipping and coating process for each eggplant slice.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium heat.
                 The oil should be hot enough for frying, but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the coated eggplant slices into the hot oil,
                 leaving space between them to ensure even cooking.</li> 
            <li>Fry the eggplant slices for a few minutes on each side until they turn golden brown and become crispy.
                 Flip them with a spatula or tongs to cook evenly.</li> 
            <li>Once fried, transfer the cooked eggplant slices to a paper towel-lined plate or tray to drain excess oil.</li> 
            <li>Repeat the frying process with the remaining eggplant slices.</li>           
         </ol>
